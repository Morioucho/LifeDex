# LifeDex: A Guidebook on Life
LifeDex is a website intended to help people who are new to living by themselves with useful guides on various amounts of topics.

# Features
- **"How To" Tutorials:** A large index of tutorials on how to do basic things, for example, "How to fold your laundry" or "How to cook food".
- **Easy Recipes:** A collection of easy recipes that would be easy for people to make. For example, Avocado on Toast.
- **Tips & Tricks:** A variety of "Tips & Tricks" that aren't very important but are still very useful.
- **Financial Advice:** A collection of financial advice on how to budget your dorm, apartment, house, loans, and other things.

# Quick Start
In order to build the program, you should have Gradle installed in an IDE of your choice.
```bash
# Ensure that you're in the folder that has the "gradlew" file present.
./gradlew bootRun
```
Following this, the website should be up on `localhost:8080`.

# Adding Changes
Updating the backend is fairly easy due to the usage of SpringBoot, every item, such as services and controllers, are stored in their respective packages: `controller`, `model`, `repository`, and `service`.

Updating the frontend is also easy as you can navigate to this folder: `src\main\resources`. You can add templates under the "template" folder (e.x. post.html) and normal pages under the "static" folder (e.x. index.html).

# Roadmap
There are a variety of planned features for the future, as of 7/20/2024, the core features are yet to be created.
